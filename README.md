# dadbot
Bot that acts like a father figure for those who don't have fathers...

This is a bot that is meant to be used on a Slack chat.

Purely for fun, it responds with "Hi __, I'm dad!" whenever a person matches a certain regex.


Example:
John: Its been such a long day, I'm so tired. 

Dad Bot: Hi tired, I'm Dad!
